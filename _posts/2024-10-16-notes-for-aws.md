[Notes for AWS](https://opengrs.com/noteaws) is a collection of notes for learning Amazon Web Service.

## What is the hope of the world? 

Have you asked the questions **what is the hope of the world**?

There is an answer from Stephen Walfram that the world is from a basic science of the phenomenon of computational irreducibly, so it tells us the world is reliable. On the other hand, there are always some pockets of computational reducible, which encourage us to explore more patterns of the world; because they can be found.

Therefore, the hope of world come from computing and  is controlled by it too. 

## What is cloud computing? 


The word "cloud" here is not related to the literal "cloud", but it refers to the Internet. It is hard to seperate a cloud from another cloud, because cloud can easily become one in the sky. Cloud computing work in the same way that it connects the computing resources in different locations and then provide services as one resource.

The fundamental change of cloud computing is not only the new way of arranging computing resources, but also redefining the idea to use resources. It become a utility which can be easier to use for everyone on-demand to achieve their goals in digital world with manageable cost. It satisfy the adaptive and rapid changing application development lifecycle.

## What is cloud deployment model?


There are three cloud deployment models: 

### Cloud
A cloud-based application is fully deployed in the cloud and all parts of the application run in the cloud.[2](https://aws.amazon.com/types-of-cloud-computing/)

### Hbybird

A please visit hybrid deployment is a way to connect infrastructure and applications between cloud-based resources and existing resources that are not located in the cloud.[2](https://aws.amazon.com/types-of-cloud-computing/)

### On-Premises

Deploying resources on-premises, using virtualization and provide resource management tools does not provide many of the benefits of cloud computing but is sometimes sought for its ability to provide dedicated resources. .[2](https://aws.amazon.com/types-of-cloud-computing/)

## How to learn cloud computing?


The best way to learn is build the knowledge tree. The main branches of the this tree can from the two directions: 
* Fundamental architecture of computer 
* Best practice of using computing resources 

Cloud computing is a new norm for computing infrastructure, but the basic science of computer have not been changed, which is from the Von Neumann architecture. It consist of input/output, storage(memory), control units and arithmetic logic unit as per following [3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture#/media/File:Von_Neumann_Architecture.svg) Therefore, all the computing services in cloud computing can refer to these components even if their requirements are various in different use cases.

On other hand, cloud computing is a complex system and it needs to achieve or balance the goals in a few areas. Therefore AWS Well-Architect framework can be an entry point of best practice for using cloud computing. It includes 6 pillars[4](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/definitions.html)

| **Name**                   | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Operational excellence** | The ability to support development and run workloads effectively, gain insight into their operations, and to continuously improve supporting processes and procedures to deliver business value.                                                                                                                                         |
| **Security**               | The security pillar describes how to take advantage of cloud technologies to protect data, systems, and assets in a way that can improve your security posture.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Reliability**            | The reliability pillar encompasses the ability of a workload to perform its intended function correctly and consistently when it’s expected to. This includes the ability to operate and test the workload through its total lifecycle. This paper provides in-depth, best practice guidance for implementing reliable workloads on AWS. |
| **Performance efficiency** | The ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements, and to maintain that efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Cost optimization**      | The ability to run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Sustainability**         | The ability to continually improve sustainability impacts by reducing energy consumption and increasing efficiency across all components of a workload by maximizing the benefits from the provisioned resources and minimizing the total resources                                                                                      |

**Tips to Remember**
* **OS Rely on Performance from CS**
	* OS:  Operational System
	* CS: Computer Science
